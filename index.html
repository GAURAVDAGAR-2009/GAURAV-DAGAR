      <p>Which is located in <strong> East-Africa.</strong> I live near the capital city of <strong>Nairobi</strong> in Machakos county. I am currently on End-of-year school holiday 
    and decided to take a <a><a href=https://www.udemy.com/>Udemy</a></strong> course to gather some basic knowledge about programming, and created this
    website through a <i>html</i> learning course. I enjoy taking this course as it helps me better understand the process of creating
    a website that is posted on the internet.I attend SCLPSSchoolüè´ found in Nairobi-West, I am currently in 8th grade at the age of 
    13 years and I want to continue developing this page as I learn more about programming.</p>
